Program :


A string S is passed as the input. A positive integer X is also passed as the input. The program
must print the characters at positions which are multiples of X.
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains X.
Output Format:
The first line contains the characters at positions which are multiples of X.
Boundary Conditions:
Length of S will be from 3 to 100.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
abcdexyzwqpoolj
5
Output:
eqj
Explanation:
The multiples of 5 are like 5, 10, 15,...
So the characters in these positions are e,q,j






Code :

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String str=sc.nextLine();
		int n=str.length();
		int x=sc.nextInt();
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
		    int a=i+1;
		    if(a%x==0) {
		        System.out.print(str.charAt(i));
		    }
		}

	}
}
